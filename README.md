# BuilderBot
A program to build teams for Pokemon Showdown in the gen8nationaldexag & gen7anythinggoes formats

Use config.cutoff to change the building style by changing it between 0 and 10.  Lower cutoffs result in more offensive teams that are less likely to have effective meta checks, while higher cutoffs generally result in bulkier teams. 
Add additional sets to sets.json. 
In order to run the teambuilder, open Terminal / cmd, cd into the builderbot file, and run "node builder".

- Note: dev branch may be unreliable / produce really bad teams

###### TODO ######
- Add more sets
- Automatically upload teams to Pokepaste
- Add gen6 support
