# BuilderBot
A program to build teams for Pokemon Showdown in the gen8nationaldexag format

use config.cutoff to change the building style by changing it between 0 and 10.  Lower cutoffs result in more offensive teams that are less likely to have effective meta checks, while higher cutoffs generally result in bulkier teams. 
Add additional sets to sets.json. 
Teams are exported in the console, so make sure debug mode is on and add a breakpoint anywhere in the program to access teams

- Note: dev branch may be unreliable / produce really bad teams

######## TODO
- Add more sets
